                    <h2>Hi, I'm Rahul Joshi!</h2>
                    <p>I'm a student at University of Southern California studying Electrical Engineering! While I do love studying electrical engineering, I have a myriad of other interests, 
                        and recently, I've realized that my passions lie in web/app development and art! I have internship experience in DevOps, app development (mostly using Python), and I'm currently 
                        a Teaching Assistant at USC for a camp called CS@SC, where I teach kids about web development and Scratch. The programming languages I'm familiar with are HTML/CSS, JavaScript, 
                        C++, Python, and Verilog, and I'm familiar with frameworks like Bootstrap, React, and Express. I'm currently in a Full Stack Development course at USC, and I'm also taking multiple Udemy 
                        courses (ex. one that also teaches Full Stack Development, one that teaches React in depth, and one that teaches implementation of the MERN stack).

            <h1 class="page-title">Zero Tolerance Policy</h1>
            <h2>Policy Guidelines</h2>
            <p>Rahul Joshi and all his derivative organizations prohibit sexual harassment (which includes, but is not limited to,
                harassment based on gender or transgender status), as well as harassment based on race, color, national origin,
                ancestry, religion, creed, physical or mental disability, medical condition, and any other basis protected by
                federal,
                state or local law. He is committed to providing a safe environment by maintaining strict policies prohibiting
                unlawful
                discrimination and harassment of any kind. Working alongside Rahul comes with the expectation to comply with said
                policies; any such discrimination or harassment in violation of these policies will be treated as a serious offense
                and
                will result in appropriate disciplinary action, which will include termination from any and all organizations
                created,
                led, or managed by Rahul Joshi.</p>
            
            <h2>Describing Harassment</h2>
            <p>Sexual and unlawful harassment includes, but is not limited to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Verbal (spoken or written) conduct, such as derogatory comments, slurs, jokes or unwanted sexual advances,
                    invitations
                    or comments.</li>
                <li>Visual conduct, such as derogatory gestures, posters, cartoons, drawings, e-mail, text messages or social media.
                </li>
                <li>Physical conduct, such as assault, blocking normal movement, or interference with participation directed at
                    another
                    member because of the member’s sex or other protected characteristic.</li>
                <li>Use of computers, including the Internet, e-mail, or social media, to transmit, communicate or receive sexually
                    suggestive, pornographic or sexually explicit pictures, messages or material or any other unlawful harassment.
                </li>
                <li>Retaliation for having reported unlawful harassment. Sexually harassing conduct can be committed by a person of
                    any gender identification.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Actions Taken</h2>
            <p>Rahul does not consider conduct in violation of these policies to be within the course and scope of his
                organizations.
                If he determines that unlawful harassment has occurred, effective remedial action will be taken appropriate to the
                circumstances. Rahul will advise all concerned persons of the results of the investigation on a need-to-know-basis.
                In
                addition, he does not condone retaliation against any other member for cooperating in an investigation or for making
                a
                truthful complaint regarding discrimination or harassment. Further, there will be no retaliation against any member
                for
                filing a truthful complaint of discrimination or harassment and Rahul will not tolerate or permit retaliation by any
                member of his organizations. Members who feel they have been retaliated against should follow the written complaint
                procedure established for the organization. If an incident of retaliation is substantiated, appropriate disciplinary
                action, including termination, will be taken.</p>
            
            <p>Rahul will continue to hold a high standard for anyone and everyone he works with, but that standard most importantly
                pertains to
                social and cultural awareness. He believes that a person isn’t good at what they do unless they’re also a good
                person. One of
                Rahul's many goals is to educate the communities he is a part of with the support and love of others, so that he
                and her communities may look inwards, identify implicit biases, and improve as human beings. Those who are looking
                to
                work with Rahul must agree to prevent discrimination, harassment and retaliation by complying with the
                aforementioned
                policies.</p>
